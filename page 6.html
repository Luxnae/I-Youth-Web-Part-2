                <h2>Analysis of the Viewership of Our Stream</h2>
                <div class="body"><p>We reached about 130 viewers even though they were not watching <br>at the same time. The reason for this is because we promoted <br>everyday, especially 3 days before the stream and also because we <br>invited the people we know personally.<br>This could have been even more if we had less competition on this <br>day and if we started our stream at a later time. Overall however, <br>we are satisfied.</p></div>
